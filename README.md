Lamp Code Editor

Developing code with refactoring to provide user-readable solutions. I learned that every if statement should carry a Switch case to work on each string individually. I found certain bug errors along the way while coding and noticed that VSCode's IntelliSense is tricky while writing lines of code. 

It may add attributes that could render the program with errors if not read carefully. I always double-check it as well to identify potential logic and compilation errors.
